  * Ontology: I did this website on the generations of the BMW M3. The information I needed was the specs and history of each of the 5 generations of the M3. 
  * Choreography: First the user reads about the 5 generations of the M3, then the user can go to the second page to sign up for the newsletter.
  
# Design
  * I implemented the Z pattern for my home page. Even though it is advised to use the F pattern for when there is lots of information, based on the simple facts I wrote about each car, I decided that the Z pattern was best. Also, since I have many Div's, the F pattern would not work as well.
  * I implemented the Z pattern for the second page - form page. It made sense for the user to read the title, then continue and fill out the form.
  * CRAP
    ** Contrast: Used mostly for the H1's of the headers. I used a dark background and paired it with a white title.
    ** Repitition: When describing the different M3's, I used the same type of layout for each.
    ** Alignment: I aligned the pictures of the cars with the text next to it. 
    
  * Fonts: For the text I chose PT Sans Narrow, because it resembled BMW's modern fonts. For the nav bar, I chose Poppins because its a very simple looking font that makes the nav bar stand out but not get in the way. 
  * I structured both pages similarly, in that there is a full-width header with a title. Under that I created simple div's, with simple styling to make the website look simple but modern. I also added padding wherever I could to reduce clutter, especially on the first page.
